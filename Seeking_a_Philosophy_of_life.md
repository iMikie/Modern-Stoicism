Modern Stoicism -- A Philosophy of Living

I am seeking a philosophy of Life.  Here's what I want it to do for me.

*I want to be reasonably happy.  My philosophy should provide a practical path.
*I want be able to make decisions: 
	*should I quit my job and pursue a passion?
	*What do I owe other people?  When can I say 'no' without equivocation 
	*How much should I seek fame and fortune, how much do I care?  
	*I don't want to spend years pursuing something only to find out that it was a mistake.  I've already done that once.
	*What do I do about fear?  Fear leads me to denial and that leads to bad decisions.
	*When do I pay attention to politics and the epidemic corruption?  When should ignore it?  When to take up arms?  How do I make that decision?
	*How much should I be an island to myself?  How much should I try to fix things?
	*What of many ideas should I dedicate myself to?
*I want a highly defensible idea of right and wrong. 
*If virtue is doing what is right, I'd like living virtuously to lead to being hhappy.  I want to refuse to do wrong for very clear reasons, one of which should be that doing right truly leads to a better life.

*When should I complain?  When should I let insults and immoral acts against me go?
