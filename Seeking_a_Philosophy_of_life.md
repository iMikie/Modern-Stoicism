#Modern Stoicism -- A Philosophy of Living
A Stoic is not stoic.  A Stoic doesn't lack emotion but stoicism does suggest ways to reduce negative emotion.  Who wouldn't want that? They agreed, as we might today, that a life full of negatibve emotions, fear, anxiety, grief, guilt, revenge, will not be fun, and likely not very valuable, or sustainable.   Unlike Zen it does not seek to eliminate the ego, destroy the self or eliminate all desire such that you feel nothing.  I don't believe in Nirvana.

Zen tree example.

  
I am seeking a philosophy of Life.  Here's what I want it to do for me.

What is a philospy of Life, anyway?
* Only pleasure can leave one's life empty and devoid of meaning or value
* Why are you alive?  What is your goal?  Is it enough to sustain you?
* As long as you are busy every minute of the day and fighting local, immediate battles, you may not notice this until relatively late. Most of us concern oursleves with the urgent at the neglect of the important.  
* Art of Stoic Joy: without a phil of life, danger that you will mislive, you will look back and realize that many of the things you did have no value to you and that many you would are now out of your reach.  You will have wasted your one shot.
* 

Is Stoicism compatible with Christianity or other Abrahamic religions?
Serenity prayer
C influenced by Stoicism and vice versa
Whether or not there is a God, certain practices lead to happiness and others do not.  

Don't go looking in the Philosophy department of a University.  
* logic, metaphysics, politics, science religion, ethics, sport, feminist but nothing to help you live your life
* This gives philosophy a bad name.  Epicurus: Valin is the word of a philosopher which does not heal any suffering of man." Epicurus, 54
* Seneca: He who studies with a philosppher shoudl take away with him some one good thing every day: he should daily return home a sounder man, or on the way to become sounder. -- Seneca, Ad Lucilium, CVIII.4
* Kind of a waste, if you ask me.
* I want something that has practical application and which I can test. What excercises should I do and at what intervals?
* It got me thinking about what I want from a philosophy of life.
 * Do X, Y, and Z and you will be happy
 * live a fulfilled life
 * decrease fear
 * decrease the ability of others to hurt you
 * know when to let events go and when you must fight back
 * 
* 
* Also ethics.
  * When should you feel guilty, when not?
  * Is there an absolute right and wrong?  To the extent that the writings of these old guys really resonate today you might wonder how much really has changed.  Is what is ethical merely relative or situational, subject to change at the moment.  Given our ability to deceive ourselves I am suspicious of any notion that lets one decide what is right and wrong as one goes along. If I wait till I'm under the gun, stressed out, I'll make a mistake.  When I get in that situation I want to already have thought it out and made my decision in a calm reflective moment.  
  * Ancient philosophy was 


* I want to be reasonably happy.  My philosophy should provide a practical path.
* I want be able to make decisions: 
	* should I quit my job and pursue a passion?
	* What do I owe other people?  When can I say 'no' without equivocation 
	* How much should I seek fame and fortune, how much do I care?  
	* I don't want to spend years pursuing something only to find out that it was a mistake.  I've already done that once.
	* What do I do about fear?  Fear leads me to denial and that leads to bad decisions.
	* When do I pay attention to politics and the epidemic corruption?  When should ignore it?  When to take up arms?  How do I make that decision?
	* How much should I be an island to myself?  How much should I try to fix things?
	* What of many ideas should I dedicate myself to?
* I want a highly defensible idea of right and wrong. 
* If virtue is doing what is right, I'd like living virtuously to lead to being hhappy.  I want to refuse to do wrong for very clear reasons, one of which should be that doing right truly leads to a better life.

*When should I complain?  When should I let insults and immoral acts against me go?

Cynic: the aserbic, holier than thou, homeless of the ancient world.
Hedonistic, Skeptic, and Stoic.

Why I'm not a Zen

Definition of stoic: one who is seemingly indifferent to or unaffected by joy, grief, pleasure, or pain. American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 3rd ed.

Seneca: someone who practices stoicism "must, whether he wills or not, necessarily be attende by constant cheerfulness and a joy tha tis deep and issues from deep within, since he finds delight in his own resources, and desires no goys greater than his inner joys. 

But I like a good beer too, and a warm house.



Seneca
Cato
Epicurious
Marcus Aurelius
Musonius Rufus: a cheerful disposition and secure joy" will follow.

Not Zen retreators from life.  Not the sappy, "everything happens for a reason."  Zen master someone came up and chopped of his leg but he was so not of this world that he still revelled in joy at the person and presented his other leg. Give me a break.  I don't think I can achieve that, I'm not sure I want to.  It has always struck me as a kind of arrogant, nya, nya, you can't hurt me, see how powerful I am (without having to actually be powerful.)  I will repeat some of the Zen illustrations I've been regaled with over the years and why so many just rubbed me the wrong way.  So many seemed designed to convince one first and foremost of the status and holiness of the monk.  The seeker of knowledge invariably comes to the master, suplicates himself so we know who has the higher status.  Eventually the master deigns to respond, and how dare anyone disturb his supreme holiness, only to issue a devastating put-down that leaves the questioner confused or prostrate...but not you the reader if you buy into it.  It's not very subtle emotional and psychologtical manipulation.

I'd rather be the guy who stops the butchering evil doer and makes sure 

Overcoming our insatiability, our consumer nature.  When is enough?  Steve Jobs to Larry Elison. Stoics had an answer.

Schools of Stoic Philosophy: why they had them.

We seek fame, is this good or bad, or to what level?  If you are on your way, when should you stop?  How much is healthy?  Is pursuing fame or fortune bad?  Is having it bad, or just pursuing it?  Is that a contradiction?  

Stoics sought peace and tranquility but not a zombie like state.  Eliminate or derail opportunities for negative emotions and encourage those for positive emotions.  Imagine actually studying this.

Identify sources of distress and avoid or eliminate them
Don't waste time with what you can't control.
 * or at least know when to ignore and when you gotta do something about it.
 * observer of your own life.

Being social was one thing I learned 

Even Enlightened Hedonism  takes effort.  Trips to discover new exiting things to do.  Studying the nature of pleasure and burnout.  Short term Hedonism, usually ends in an early death. And that maximizes nothing.

I add meditation to Stoicism, it is "mindfulness" but is pretty much the opposite of Zen practices.  
Story of the tree.

The rise of Stoicism
* what is the minimum here that I can just point to other sources.
* Why did Stoicism arise?  Why was it popular?  Why did it die out?
*

The Dichotomy of Control
Fatalism, Let go of the past
Self Denial: the dark side of pleasure
Meditation

History
500-600BC philosophy leaps forward from seemingly no where arises in Italy, Greece, Confucius in China, Buddha in India.

Pythagoras inItaly to Epicurus, rival to Stoics
Anaximander to Socrates

Before Socrates: scienctists.  After: study of men's souls.  How to live a good life and made it into a competitive business.  If it didn't perform, it would die out.

Why God didn't cut it for me.
Most religious people I know go off and from M-F behave like anyone else.  Some of the least ethical people I have experienced in my life have been the most religious.

Hutterites:  would you do that?

I want a philosophy (or religion if you want) that does tell me how to live my life but it can't be "because God tells us so."  Having never talked directly to God myself I only know what others tell me God says to do and they are never consistent.  So when someone say, "God says this..." my answer is, "so you say."  

Do this not because God says so but...
 * because this will ultimately make you happy.
 * because this will cut down the noise and negative emotions
 * this will prevent you from being taken advantage of
 * this will prevent you from being needlessly hurt.
 * this will help you make better decisions when you can't make up your mind
 * 
I'm also quite wary of people who tell me that God says to give them my money.  Or that God has allowed them to break rules of common decency.

Gods rules run delayed behind societies rules.


Fraturnity excercise

Zeno of Citium

Why not cynic (page 29, joy)
What sort of woman makes the best wife?  None, no matter what, you will regret marrying her.  If she is pretty you won't have her to yourself.  If she's ugly, you will.

Pay attention to your enemies for, for they are the first to discover your mistakes. --Antisthenes

Diogenes of Sinope (also relate the Alexander story) "the gods have given to men the means of living easily, but this has been put out of sight because we desire lots of things we don't really need.  Can't get of the rat race merry-go-round.  For years I sat, not knowing what I liked to do.  And if I cut down my lifestyle I could live forever simply.  

Diogenese: be prepared for every fortune.  If it doesn't take you by surprise, it's power to hurt you is less.

Cynics:  avoid all "good things", comforts, security because these might be taken away from you.  To me this is like saying beat yourself every day with a whip because some day someone might do that to you.  

Stoics: creature comforts are fine, just don't get attached to them.  To make sure you aren't, give them up periodically and live simply.  You'll find that you are just as happy.  Seneca was one of the richest men in Rome.  Had it all confiscated by Claudius who banished him and he was just as happy on Corsica, eventually to rise again.

Zeno: Logic and reasoning, prove all things and hold fast to that which is true. the truth will set you free.  an assertion to be sure.

Physics or science was part of Zeno.
Ethics: what do we need to do to live well and flourish.  Virtue is not about sex.
Virtue for a human is doing what a man is designed to do. Reason (logic and science) were to help us discover what that is.  Ethics is how to do it.
 * what were we designed to do?
  * hunger-eat
  * sex - reproduce
  * cooperate with others, without that nothing is possible
  * from that many rules and behaviors follow.
  * user our reason... be reasonable
  * 

Why these?  

Virtue, logic, science abandoned by the Romans who valued tranquility.

Romans had less confidence that the Greeks in the power of pur reason to motivate people.  -- probably right. But it's big for me so I like it.  Romans believed that men would follow their baser passions and that those would end up in unhappiness was more motivating.

Sugarcoat virtue with tranquilty.  Tranquiltiy was a selling point and so adopted.  Is tranquility important to you?  It is getting more and more so to me as I get older but adventure and challenge were more important early in my life.  Can we apply Stoicism to that?

I don't like parties.  Which should I go to.  Which can I happily refrain from?  

Seneca's essay, On the Happy Life, written for his elder brother Gallio the very same mentioned in Acts 18:12-16 for hisrefusal to try St. Paul in Corinth.  page 45.  

Tranquilty: use our reason to drive away "all that excites or affrights us." If we do this ther ewill ensue "unbroken tranquility and enduring freedom". 
Constand cheerfulness and a joy that is deep and issues from deep within, since he finds delight in his own resources, and desire no joys greater than his inner joys."  No idea of what that last phrase means.  Joys of the flesh are "paltry and trivial and fleeting" page 48

Musonias: studying philosophy should affect us personally and profoundly; indeed, when a philosopher lectures his words should make those in his audienceshudder and feel ashamed. (what in God's sake for?). When he is done speaking, they shoudl, rather than applauding him, have been reduces to silence.  Why?  I should be elated instead.  If what I have been doing is truly not the road to happiness then I shoudl be pretty happy to have discovered a better road.  I'm not into the guilt trip for guilt trip sake.  "laying before them traits of which they were secretly ashamed."  Why so?  Be happy at an opportunity to improve.  If you can't then you will be less happy than you could have.  

Must participate in the world, unlike the Epiciurians.

Epictitus: ideal pupil: someone who will be satisfied if he can "live untrammelled and untroubled," as someone who seeks to be "tranqauil and free from turmoil."
 page 51
 
 Just like wood is the medium of the carpenter and bronze is the medium of the sculptor, your life is the medium on which you practice the art of living. page 51  Thus as a master carpenter teaches a student the tricks and tools of the trade show should the philosopher teach his student the tools and tricks of life. 
 
 Zeus admits he is not all powerful and could not give man sound body and existence free and unhapmered.  But since he couldn't he gave man reason and choice, desire and aversion. Make use of it and you won't be frustrated or unhappy.  
 It is difficulties that show us what we are.  54  
 
Reversals in life should, rather than derail you, serve to test and refine your ability to deal with it.  LIve in accordance with nature.

marcus Arelius - last of the good emperors.  

The philosphers denegration non philosophical people as those "working hard to be able to afford the latest consumer gadget, in the resolute belief that if only they buy enough stuff, they will have a life that is both meaningful and maximally fuilfilling." 

Doesn't pass the front door test.  Those who I have known like this are few and far between.  Most people I know are driven by a dedication to their children, making ends meet which now takes two incomes.  They need a car to get to work and, yes, they'd like it to be a nice one but though I see some stirving for status and income as a sign of status and importance, that is the goal, not to have the latest consumer gadget.  Teenagers that do are typically falling into the need of that age to stand out.  To gain the status within their group that will allow them to get a mate.  That's normal and human.  If philosphy has something to say it's has to deal with status, and mating.

Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will and selfishness--all of them due to the offenders' ignorance of what is good or evil."

Why did Stoicism fall into decline?





OK, how do you do that?
