#Modern Stoicism -- A Philosophy of Living
A Stoic is not stoic.  A Stoic doesn't lack emotion but stoicism does suggest ways to reduce negative emotion.  Who wouldn't want that? They agreed, as we might today, that a life full of negatibve emotions, fear, anxiety, grief, guilt, revenge, will not be fun, and likely not very valuable, or sustainable.   Unlike Zen it does not seek to eliminate the ego, destroy the self or eliminate all desire such that you feel nothing.  I don't believe in Nirvana.

Zen tree example.

  
I am seeking a philosophy of Life.  Here's what I want it to do for me.

What is a philospy of Life, anyway?
* Only pleasure can leave one's life empty and devoid of meaning or value
* Why are you alive?  What is your goal?  Is it enough to sustain you?
* As long as you are busy every minute of the day and fighting local, immediate battles, you may not notice this until relatively late. Most of us concern oursleves with the urgent at the neglect of the important.  
* Art of Stoic Joy: without a phil of life, danger that you will mislive, you will look back and realize that many of the things you did have no value to you and that many you would are now out of your reach.  You will have wasted your one shot.
* 

Is Stoicism compatible with Christianity or other Abrahamic religions?
Serenity prayer
C influenced by Stoicism and vice versa
Whether or not there is a God, certain practices lead to happiness and others do not.  

Don't go looking in the Philosophy department of a University.  
* logic, metaphysics, politics, science religion, ethics, sport, feminist but nothing to help you live your life
* This gives philosophy a bad name.  Epicurus: Valin is the word of a philosopher which does not heal any suffering of man." Epicurus, 54
* Seneca: He who studies with a philosppher shoudl take away with him some one good thing every day: he should daily return home a sounder man, or on the way to become sounder. -- Seneca, Ad Lucilium, CVIII.4
* Kind of a waste, if you ask me.
* I want something that has practical application and which I can test. What excercises should I do and at what intervals?
* It got me thinking about what I want from a philosophy of life.
 * Do X, Y, and Z and you will be happy
 * live a fulfilled life
 * decrease fear
 * decrease the ability of others to hurt you
 * know when to let events go and when you must fight back
 * 
* 
* Also ethics.
  * When should you feel guilty, when not?
  * Is there an absolute right and wrong?  To the extent that the writings of these old guys really resonate today you might wonder how much really has changed.  Is what is ethical merely relative or situational, subject to change at the moment.  Given our ability to deceive ourselves I am suspicious of any notion that lets one decide what is right and wrong as one goes along. If I wait till I'm under the gun, stressed out, I'll make a mistake.  When I get in that situation I want to already have thought it out and made my decision in a calm reflective moment.  
  * Ancient philosophy was 


* I want to be reasonably happy.  My philosophy should provide a practical path.
* I want be able to make decisions: 
	* should I quit my job and pursue a passion?
	* What do I owe other people?  When can I say 'no' without equivocation 
	* How much should I seek fame and fortune, how much do I care?  
	* I don't want to spend years pursuing something only to find out that it was a mistake.  I've already done that once.
	* What do I do about fear?  Fear leads me to denial and that leads to bad decisions.
	* When do I pay attention to politics and the epidemic corruption?  When should ignore it?  When to take up arms?  How do I make that decision?
	* How much should I be an island to myself?  How much should I try to fix things?
	* What of many ideas should I dedicate myself to?
* I want a highly defensible idea of right and wrong. 
* If virtue is doing what is right, I'd like living virtuously to lead to being hhappy.  I want to refuse to do wrong for very clear reasons, one of which should be that doing right truly leads to a better life.

*When should I complain?  When should I let insults and immoral acts against me go?

Hedonistic, Skeptic, and Stoic.

Why I'm not a Zen

Definition of stoic: one who is seemingly indifferent to or unaffected by joy, grief, pleasure, or pain. American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 3rd ed.

Seneca: someone who practices stoicism "must, whether he wills or not, necessarily be attende by constant cheerfulness and a joy tha tis deep and issues from deep within, since he finds delight in his own resources, and desires no goys greater than his inner joys. 

But I like a good beer too, and a warm house.



Seneca
Cato
Epicurious
Marcus Aurelius
Musonius Rufus: a cheerful disposition and secure joy" will follow.

Not Zen retreators from life.  Not the sappy, "everything happens for a reason."  Zen master someone came up and chopped of his leg but he was so not of this world that he still revelled in joy at the person and presented his other leg. Give me a break.  I don't think I can achieve that, I'm not sure I want to.  It has always struck me as a kind of arrogant, nya, nya, you can't hurt me, see how powerful I am (without having to actually be powerful.)  I will repeat some of the Zen illustrations I've been regaled with over the years and why so many just rubbed me the wrong way.  So many seemed designed to convince one first and foremost of the status and holiness of the monk.  The seeker of knowledge invariably comes to the master, suplicates himself so we know who has the higher status.  Eventually the master deigns to respond, and how dare anyone disturb his supreme holiness, only to issue a devastating put-down that leaves the questioner confused or prostrate...but not you the reader if you buy into it.  It's not very subtle emotional and psychologtical manipulation.

I'd rather be the guy who stops the butchering evil doer and makes sure 

Overcoming our insatiability, our consumer nature.  When is enough?  Steve Jobs to Larry Elison. Stoics had an answer.

Schools of Stoic Philosophy: why they had them.

We seek fame, is this good or bad, or to what level?  If you are on your way, when should you stop?  How much is healthy?  Is pursuing fame or fortune bad?  Is having it bad, or just pursuing it?  Is that a contradiction?  

Stoics sought peace and tranquility but not a zombie like state.  Eliminate or derail opportunities for negative emotions and encourage those for positive emotions.  Imagine actually studying this.

Identify sources of distress and avoid or eliminate them
Don't waste time with what you can't control.
 * or at least know when to ignore and when you gotta do something about it.
 * observer of your own life.

Being social was one thing I learned 

Even Enlightened Hedonism  takes effort.  Trips to discover new exiting things to do.  Studying the nature of pleasure and burnout.  Short term Hedonism, usually ends in an early death. And that maximizes nothing.

I add meditation to Stoicism, it is "mindfulness" but is pretty much the opposite of Zen practices.  
Story of the tree.
